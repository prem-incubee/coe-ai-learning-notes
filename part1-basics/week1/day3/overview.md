# Day 3: AI Coding Assistants (Copilot & Cursor)

_Summary for self and review: what we cover and what we deliver by end of day._

**Goal:** Use GitHub Copilot or Cursor in your workflow and practice when to accept vs. iterate on AI suggestions.

**By the end you will:**

- Have Copilot or Cursor set up in your editor
- Complete String Calculator and FizzBuzz katas with AI
- Refactor one legacy piece (min 50 lines) with AI
- Document 3 patterns where AI helped and 3 where it struggled
- Explain when to accept vs. iterate on suggestions

**Topics:** Setup, accept/reject/iterate, chat vs inline, Cursor basics, katas and refactor.

**Flow:** [setup.md](./setup.md) → [using-ai.md](./using-ai.md) → [exercises.md](./exercises.md). Complete [reflection.md](./reflection.md) when done (for self and review).
