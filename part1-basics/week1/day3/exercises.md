# Day 3 Exercises

_Practice tasks; use Copilot or Cursor for all. Commit often so history shows AI use (useful for self and review)._

**1. String Calculator**  
Implement `add(numbers)` per kata rules: empty → 0, comma/newline delimiters, custom `//;\n1;2;3`, negatives throw, numbers > 1000 ignored. See [stringCalculator.js](./stringCalculator.js) for a reference. Add tests and commit step by step.

**2. FizzBuzz**  
Function from 1 to N: divisible by 3 → "Fizz", by 5 → "Buzz", by both → "FizzBuzz", else the number. See [fizzbuzz.js](./fizzbuzz.js). Add tests; note when you accepted vs iterated.

**3. Refactor legacy (min 50 lines)**  
Pick one messy function or file. Use chat or inline edit to refactor (extract helpers, better names). Keep behavior the same; document before/after and AI’s role.

**4. Document patterns**  
Write 3 situations where AI helped and 3 where it struggled (e.g. wrong API, missing edge case). Brief is fine.

**5. Accept vs iterate**  
In [reflection.md](./reflection.md): one example of accept, one of iterate, one of reject—and why.
