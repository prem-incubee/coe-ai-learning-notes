# Reflection – Week 1, Day 3: AI Coding Assistants (GitHub Copilot & Cursor)

## Update

Completed Day 3 covering setup and use of Copilot/Cursor, accept/reject/iterate on AI suggestions, inline vs chat-based coding, and katas (String Calculator, FizzBuzz) plus legacy refactoring with AI.

## Reflection – AI Coding Assistants

### What I Learned

- How to set up and use GitHub Copilot (or Cursor) in my editor
- When to accept, reject, or iterate on AI suggestions—and why it matters for quality
- How to use Copilot Chat (or Cursor chat) for explanations and debugging
- Differences between inline editing and chat-based coding, and when to use each
- How to complete katas and refactor legacy code with AI assistance

### What Surprised Me

- I had to iterate more often than I expected—especially on String Calculator edge cases (empty string, custom delimiter). Accept worked well for FizzBuzz and boilerplate.
- Chat was much more useful than inline for "implement this kata from the rules"; inline was better for renames and small fixes.

### How I Will Use This

- Use inline for small edits and chat for new features or refactors; always run tests after accepting.
- I'll keep noting when AI helps vs struggles so I get faster at deciding accept vs iterate.
