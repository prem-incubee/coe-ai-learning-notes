# Week 1 - Day 1: AI/LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Engineering Basics

## Learning Objectives

Understanding AI, LLMs, and Effective Prompting

## Success Criteria

By the end of Day 1, you should be able to:

1. **Explain what LLMs are and how they process text**
   - Understand the basic architecture and function of Large Language Models
   - Grasp how LLMs predict and generate text
   - Understand the training process (pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF)

2. **Understand tokens and context window concepts**
   - Define what tokens are and how text is tokenized
   - Understand context windows and their limitations
   - Know how to work within context constraints

3. **Write 10 progressively better prompts showing clear improvement**
   - Start with basic prompts and iterate
   - Apply learned techniques to improve prompt quality
   - Demonstrate understanding of prompt engineering principles

4. **Identify and explain 3 AI limitations with examples**
   - Recognize common failure modes
   - Understand where LLMs struggle
   - Know when to rely on LLMs and when not to

5. **Create a prompt that successfully uses few-shot learning**
   - Demonstrate in-context learning
   - Structure examples effectively
   - Show understanding of pattern recognition

6. **Document 3 prompt patterns that work well for code-related tasks**
   - Identify effective patterns for coding assistance
   - Understand when to use each pattern
   - Apply patterns to real coding scenarios
